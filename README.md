## **Google Data Analytics Case Study on Cyclistic Bike Share**

### **Cyclistic Bike Share analysis**

#### **Introduction**
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of rider behavior for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. The goal of the analysis is to uncover meaningful differences between casual riders and annual members using historical trip data.

To support the company’s marketing strategy, I followed a structured data analysis process — Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act — to explore user trends, identify peak usage patterns, and develop actionable insights. The ultimate objective is to support data-driven recommendations aimed at converting more casual riders into annual members.

#### **About the company**
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share oering. Since then, the program has grown
to a eet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across
Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the
system anytime.

Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
exibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s nance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more protable
than casual riders. Although the pricing exibility helps Cyclistic aract more customers,
Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to beer understand how
annual members and casual riders dier, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could aect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.


#### **Scenario**
I am a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share
company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these
insights, the team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.


#### **Key Stakeholders**
Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels

#### **Business Task**
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?

3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

My task is to identify how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

#### **Data Source**
The data used covers rider information over a one-year period from April 2024 to March 2025. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. with license and is originally stored in separate CSV files organized by the different months of the year. The datasets were accessed from the following URL: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

"202501-divvy-tripdata.csv" "202502-divvy-tripdata.csv" "202503-divvy-tripdata.csv"

#### **Conclusion**
It can be concluded from the graphs that the ride share members use the bikes consistently every day for a brief period of time, while casual riders use them more inconsistently. On average, casual riders use them for significantly longer time than members. It is also evident that they ride bikes less often during the week and more on Saturdays and Sundays. In summary, it appears that the casual riders use ride share for leisure and enjoyment, while members use it primarily for transportation for their everyday routines.
